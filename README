Latest version from maven central is [#Maven_dependency_and_how_to_build: 1.0.0]. Link to [https://code.google.com/p/vibur-object-pool/source/browse/trunk/CHANGELOG changelog].

Vibur Object Pool is a concurrent Java object pool which provides
both validating and non-validating pool implementations. The pool is built
entirely using the standard Java concurrency utilities, does not use any synchronized blocks/methods,
and does not have any external dependencies. This pool is an excellent choice for pooling/caching
of expensive to create Java objects such as database connections (or any other socket connections to remote hosts) 
and similar. The pool is utilized by [https://code.google.com/p/vibur-dbcp/ Vibur DBCP], a JDBC connection pool.

=== Quick Introduction ===

==== Concurrency and performance bounds: =====

In the terms of standard Java concurrency utilities, the non-validating object pool `take` and `restore`
operations performance is bound by the same of a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue's` `poll` and `add` operations, where the
CLQ is additionally guarded by a `Semaphore`, which fairness parameter is set to `true` or `false` depending on the
pool's such. The validating pool is composed using a non-validating pool, and its performance incurs an additional 
`put` and a `remove` operation from a `ConcurrentHashMap`. While both pools employ some little additional logic 
for various house-keeping purposes, their overall performance remains a function of the mentioned above standard 
concurrency utilities.

==== Non-validating object pool: ====

The implementation of the non-validating object pool (`ConcurrentLinkedPool`)
is based on a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` and a `Semaphore`. This pool does *not*
implement any validation of whether the currently restored object has been taken
before that from the pool, or whether the object is currently in taken state.

The non-validating object pool provides support for fairness with regards to the waiting
taker's threads. The creation of new objects in the pool and their lifecycle are controlled
by the provided during the pool's creation time `PoolObjectFactory`.

The non-validating object pool provides support for manual or automated shrinking (reduction)
of the allocated on the pool objects, and the developer has full control over it
via the `reduceCreated(int)` pool method and the `SamplingPoolReducer` utilily class.

==== Validating object pool: ====

The validating object pool (`ConcurrentHolderLinkedPool`) is implemented (composed) using a
non-validating `ConcurrentLinkedPool` and a `ConcurrentHashMap` for the validation
of the restored objects. The validation checks whether the currently restored object holder has
been taken before that from the pool, and whether it is currently in taken state.

The validating object pool `take` methods are returning the pool's objects enclosed
in a thin wrapper class implementing the `Holder` interface. The underlying object is
accessible via the interface's `value()` method.

The validating object pool provides support for fairness with regards to the waiting
taker's threads in the same way as it is provided by the underlying `ConcurrentLinkedPool`.

The validating object pool has support for manual or automated shrinking (reduction)
of the allocated on the pool objects. Again, this functionality is built on
top of the same provided by the underlying `ConcurrentLinkedPool`.

=== Usage Examples ===

==== Maven dependency and how to build: ====

{{{
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.vibur</groupId>
  <artifactId>vibur-object-pool</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

A read-only copy of the source code can be checked out via:

  `svn checkout http://vibur-object-pool.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.0.0 vibur-object-pool-1.0.0`

Building the sources is simply a matter of executing:

  `mvn clean install`

==== Programming example: ====

{{{
HolderValidatingPoolService<SomeClass> pool = new ConcurrentHolderLinkedPool<SomeClass>(
        new SomeClassFactory(), 10, 60, false);

//...

Holder<SomeClass> hObj = null;
try {
    hObj = pool.tryTake(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    if (hObj == null) // i.e. no any object was available in the pool for 10 seconds
        return;

    // do some work and use hObj.value()

} finally {
    if (hObj != null)
        pool.restore(hObj, true);
}
}}}

More usage examples can be found in the project's unit tests folder.
